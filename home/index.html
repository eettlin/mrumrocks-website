        <h2>About Mr. Ettlin</h2>
            <p>
            Hello, I am Mr. Ettlin. I teach Digital Arts at Woodside High
            School in Woodside, CA.  We have an exciting Digital Arts
            Program here at Woodside.
            </p>
            <p>
            I teach web design, beginning animation, computer programming,
            and advanced animation using Blender, Java, and Flash. In addition,
            our department offers audio production, film critique, and digital
            photography.
            </p>    
        <h2>About Mr. Um</h2>
            <p>
            When I teach math classes, most of my kids call me Mr. Ettlin. 
            But, when I teach computer classes, students tend to call me Mr. Um.
            </p>
            <p>
            I suppose it is because they get so focused on the computer that
            when one needs help, he or she throws a hand up and yells for
            Mr. um&hellip; um&hellip;.
            </p>
            <p>
            In fact, I became so used to being called Mr. Um that  I just tell
            the kids on the first day of class that my name is Mr. Um&mdash;it
            saves time.
